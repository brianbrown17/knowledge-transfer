Background

The inventor of Git, Linus Torvalds, has made quips about his software since it’s inception, calling it “the stupid content tracker” and saying the project (which shares its name with the British slang “git”, meaning “unpleasant person”) is named after himself.

However, in spite of his efforts to ridicule his own work, Git’s widespread adoption has exploded since its release in 2005. Whether you are contributing to software projects online, or doing so in a corporate setting, you are almost guaranteed to be expected to use Git. 

To describe git as simply as possible, it is a piece of software that tracks changes to your project repositories (Git jargon for a folder directory). The “changes” can be as small as a single character or the addition/deletion of entire files.

Git allows you to store these changes as commits, and track them in a history that can be shared among developers, allowing independent contributions to be merged in with those of other contributors. Frankly, there’s simply no alternative to managing the complexity of a software project at with multiple contributors.

Up to this point, you may be falsely equating the term “Git” to “Github” (or the lesser known “Gitlab”'). There is an important distinction to note, that Github/Gitlab are commercial offerings which run Git software under the hood, allowing you to create and manage git repositories in the cloud. 

It’s equally important to understand how to navigate these offerings as it is to understand the basics of Git, so this tutorial will include instructions on how to get setup with Github.

Setup

First, you’ll want to make sure you have the Git software installed on your computer. This process will vary depending on your operating system, so it’s easiest to just follow this tutorial: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

To verify that Git is installed you can open up your computer’s command line and type the following command. If it displays a numeric version then you are all set!

$ git –version
git version 2.35.1

The next step is to create a Github account. Remember, this Git-based offering will allow you to store a copy of your git repositories remotely on the web, and give you access to a bunch of their other unique features.

You will use your computer's command line to interact with your files and send your changes to Github. To simplify things, you can set up a credential store on your machine. Run the following commands. The first will configure a helper to store credentials locally. The second will prompt you for those credentials, and will store them automatically.

$ git config --global credential.helper store
$ git pull

The ‘–global’ flag means that this configuration is saved across all repositories on your machine - removing it would only apply them to a single repo.

Fundamentals

There are a few key concepts that you really need to understand. However, as with most software concepts, I think it's easier to explain these as we progress.

Repositories

A repository is like Git's implementation of a project folder. Much like a project folder, the repository will encapsulate all of the project files that you need. This can vary depending on what type of project you are working on, but you can count on this including some source code, READMEs, and potentially some binaries or makefiles as well.

In addition to these project files, the Git repository will also store the changes (additions, deletions, file modifications) over time in the /.git file.

For a quick demo, let's create a simple Git repository on your computer. Again, use the command line to navigate into your project folder.

Always utilize the 'ls' command to list all files. To navigate in a subdirectory, use the ‘cd’ command. To view the path of your current location, use ‘pwd’ which stands for present-working-directory.

If you do not have a sample project folder, simply make one using the following command, then navigate into the folder.

$ mkdir hello-word
$ cd hello-world/

To turn this ordinary folder into a Git repository, use the 'init' command.

$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brianbrown/hello-world/.git/

Now the .git file exists locally on your machine, and it will track changes to this repository over time. This is helpful for you to incrementally develop your project, but like we mentioned earlier, Git truly shines when you can push your repository to a remote location.

The most common way to accomplish this is through an internet hosted application like Github. Think of your local repository as a Microsoft Word document and Github as Google Drive.

Navigate to https://github.com/new, and enter in a repository name (ensure this matches your local repository name). You shouldn't need to touch any other settings.

Once you create this, the instructions that Github provides under '…or push an existing repository from the command line' are sufficient.

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/knowledgetransferblog/hello-world.git
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main

The first command here basically defines the remote origin for your local repository, meaning that it's the Github location where you want to publish changes. While that defines, the location, it doesn't actually do anything else. 

To actually sync up the version of your project on your computer and the one on Github, you'll need to 'push' via the command line. When you push, use the '-u' flag to specify the previously defined origin as your destination, and then write 'main' to specify the branch location

We will discuss branches more in Part 2. For now, it's just important to know that you are pushing to the 'main' branch directly, which is conventionally where production-ready code lives.

One last thing. It's less common that you'll be initializing repositories in a company-setting, and much more common that you'll be doing the process in reverse. You'll use a command called 'clone', which copies a Github repository from the internet and adds a copy onto your computer. Changes you make locally won't be reflected on Github until you choose to push them later on.

Make sure you navigate outside of the 'hello-world' repository first (use 'cd ..' to travel out of a folder), then clone using the URL provided below for a repository that I've created solely for practice.

$ git clone https://github.com/knowledgetransferblog/hello-world-again

Commits

To demonstrate commits, let's start by adding a new file to our hello-world repository.

$ echo "Hello world" > hello-world.txt

The > is a command-line function to send output (in this case the echoed message) to a destination (in this case a .txt file)

If you've made a change to your project, and you're happy with it, then next thing you'd want to do is 'commit' it to the repository. But before you commit, you'll want to use the 'add' command. Add allows you to specify which files to include in Git's 'staging area', and it's helpful when you've made a lot of changes, but you aren't ready to commit them all.

$ git add hello-world.txt
$ git commit -m "add: hello-world"
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello-world.txt

It's important to use a descriptive commit message (here it follows the -m flag) to explain your changes.

So you've made a commit, what does that mean? Well, a commit is like a backup of all the staged changes of a project that's stored in the /.git file in your repository. It has information about who made the changes and when.

It also contains a commit hash. As you progress with Git you'll find it useful to be able to grab this hash. View all of this information using the 'log' command.

$ git log
commit 7b8b5d950e04893aa4719e6913eccd6477b2bb40 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Brian <brianbrown@brian-computer.local>
Date:   Thu May 12 13:09:02 2022 -0400
    add: hello-world

One thing to note here, is that so far we've only made this commit to our local repository. If you were to check your Github repository at this point you wouldn't be able to see the hello-world text file. 

To update the remote repository, we're going to follow  the same command as before to push your changes. 

$ git push -u origin main

Remember, the upstream origin should still point to the Github URL of your remote repository, or something like: https://github.com/<your_username>/hello-world.  After you push, check to see that your files landed!

Congratulations! This simple foundation is enough for you to begin using Git/Github for your side projects. It can help you break work into smaller chunks, back it up in case of accidental deletion, and showcase your projects to others!

Look out for Part 2 to learn how to use Git in a team-based environment.
